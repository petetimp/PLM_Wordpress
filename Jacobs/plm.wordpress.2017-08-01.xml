		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This past Friday, several staff members  of Jacobs &amp; Crumplar attended the 4th Annual Champions for Children Gala of Prevent Child Abuse Delaware.  Not only did we attend, but along with Barclays Bank and the Neuberger Law Firm (with whom we've tried numerous sex abuse cases), J&amp;C was the principle sponsor of the event.

Held at the Christina River Front Performing Arts, the event gave its annual award to Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden.  During his tenure as Attorney General, Biden has been a champion for victims of child abuse and has actively worked to strengthen Delaware's child abuse laws.

Below are links to Prevent Child Abuse Delaware and the Attorney General's website.

		<title>Sexual abuse by religious officials: Not a just a &quot;Catholic Priest thing&quot;</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Monday, December 10th, a NY jury found Nechemya Wberman, an unlicensed ultra-Orthodox Jewish counselor, guilty of sexual assault. As described in the NY Times, Weberman repeatedly sexually abused a young girl who had been sent to him for treatment. Allegations of abuse in the ultra-Orthodox community have been in the news for years, but few prosecutions or civil law suits have been successful, in part because many victims have been reluctant to come forward and all too often few people are willing to support the victims. Sadly those who do support victims can face harsh consequences: Rabbi Nuchem Rosenberg, a victims right advocate in the Ultra Orthodox Community had bleach thrown in his face because of his unwaveringly support of victims.
What this all shows is that sexual abuse of children by religious officials is not a "Catholic thing" or a "priest thing." Of course, sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests was and is a very prevalent and because the US has such a large Catholic population it often gets the most attention; but that doesn't mean sexual abuse doesn't happen in Protestant churches or in various branches of Judaism. Nor does the person have to be a cleric as the conviction of Nechemya Weberman demonstrates. They only need to have a position of trust and authority and access to children.
Here are the NY Times articles.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[BOY SCOUTS

As reported by The News Journal on December 13, 2012, a lawsuit against the Boy Scouts was filed in Philadelphia on December 12, 2012 alleging that a young teenager was sexually abused by his scoutmaster in the late 1990's while he was a member of Troop 84 in Downingtown, PA.   The scoutmaster would use tactics such as rewards and membership in a special brotherhood to groom and entice his victim.   The Journal reports that the suit alleges that the Boy Scouts of America knew for decades that sexual predators had infiltrated the Scouts to gain access to victims as evidence by their perversion files, a subset of their ineligible volunteer files.  The News Journal also reports that at least 14 of those files involve Boy Scout leaders in the Delaware area.

Jacobs &amp; Crumplar represents two survivors of abuse by scoutmasters who led Delaware Boy Scout troops who similarly alleged that the Boy Scouts of America knew or should have known it had a problem of childhood sexual abusers in its midst and failed to take the right steps to prevent the abuse.  The lawsuits of John Doe # 6 and John Doe # 7 were filed under the Child Victim's Act and were the first sexual abuse suits against the Boy Scouts of America to be filed in Delaware.  Trial is set for the summer of 2013 and the parties are awaiting a decision from the Superior Court regarding the production of earlier years of ineligible volunteer files than those released to the public by attorney Kelly Clark, as reported by  The News Journal on November 4, 2012.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On January 24, 2013 The New York Times reported about the cases of several survivors of childhood sexual abuse who suffered the added trauma of knowing that videos and pictures of their horrifying childhood sexual abuse were sent over the internet and downloaded and viewed by numerous people.  The article is difficult to read because of its horrifying subject matter.   But it is worth reading because it effectively expresses the point that even when these viewers and receivers of childhood pornography do not actually engage in the act of sexually abusing the child, they are fueling the demand for it and are accomplices who encourage the abuse to happen in the first place, because of the nature of their crimes and how the pictures and videos are shared among their community.  It discusses these survivors’ rights to restitution paid by the perpetrator who downloads or views their images as is discussed in a recent Opinion by the 5<sup>th</sup> Circuit Court of Appeals, <a href="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/In-re-Amy-Unknown.pdf"><span style="text-decoration: underline">In re Amy Unknown</span>, 701 F.3d 749 (5th Cir. 2012)</a>, which is attached here.  There is a Circuit split on this issue which means the Supreme Court will decide the issue to resolve the conflict among the Circuits.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A story by John Bacon of USA Today found at the link below, details how a Montana Judge sentenced a 54 year old former teacher who raped a 14 year old girl to only 30 days in prison, after he was terminated from a sex offender treatment program which permitted a deferred prosecution. The story reports that “District Judge G. Todd Baugh, in sentencing Stacey Rambold on Monday, said victim Cherice Moralez was "as much in control of the situation" as her teacher, referring to Cherice as a troubled youth "older than her chronological age,"” as reported by the Billings Gazette. The Judge apologized and explained that the rape was not “forcible beat-up rape.” While its laudable that the Judge acknowledged his comments were hurtful and wrong, the sentence of 30 days in jail for such a crime against a child speaks for itself and implies that the child consented to this rape even though legally she could not. And the greatest tragedy of the situation is that the young girl took her own life. The impact of this “non-forcible” rape on the short life and untimely death unfortunately cannot be known, but it appears greatly incongruous with a 30 day sentence for the perpetrator who was a 40 –something teacher when this happened and should be held accountable for raping a child and a student.
Contrast this with Delaware’s strong statutorily mandated jail sentences for one who “[i]ntentionally engages in sexual penetration with a child who has not yet reached that child’s own sixteenth birthday and the person stands in a position of trust, authority or supervision over the child []” Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, § 778.

On August 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> of 2013, Jacobs &amp; Crumplar attorney Elizabeth Lewis participated in the 34th 2013 Pan-Mass Challenge (PMC) which is 2-day, 192  mile bike ride across the state of Massachusetts along with 5,500 other cyclists.  The PMC raises money for research and care at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) in Boston.

The PMC raises more money for charity than any other single event in the country, $375 million since 1980 and $37 million last year alone! This success is the result of a lot of people riding for, and caring about, a cure.   

Liz rode in honor of her late husband, Steve Lewis, who died on March 15, 2006, as well as in honor of Jacobs &amp; Crumplar’s many clients who have died from cancer, many caused by asbestos or benzene or other harmful chemicals.  These clients have died from mesothelioma, lung cancer, and other types of cancers.  She placed the honorees’ names on her t-shirt which she wore during the 192 mile, which was both physically and emotionally challenging. 

Liz said that "Before the ride I was questioning my ability to finish the ride and even thought about changing to a shorter course.  But I completed the entire ride and from Sturbridge to Provincetown, the scenery was beautiful and the people I met along the way were wonderful.  I am thankful that I was able to enjoy the Pan Mass experience which is the largest athletic fundraiser in the world! "

She was required to raise $4300 but her personal goal was to raise $6000.   She did better than her personal goal and has raised $6135 for this worthy cause.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Daily Mail Online's James Nye and the AP report that Masha Allen has filed a lawsuit against approximately a dozens pedophiles who viewed pornographic images of her as a 5 to 10 year old child that were taken by her abusive adoptive father, and shared over the internet. Masha was the inspiration for Congress's passage of "Masha's Law" which gives victims of child pornography the right to sue ANYONE who is caught viewing or possessing their images.  Those pedophiles who are found liable under the law must pay at least $150,000.00 each.  This is a great law.   These victims deserve compensation from those who enabled and conspired in their child abuse.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The co-owner of a popular Newark, DE ice rink was recently arrested. Scott Bicking has been accused by two young boys of inappropriate contact. A criminal investigation is still under way. Individuals who pray on children often seek avenues such as youth organizations (sports, religious groups) to gain access to children. Parents should always be aware with whom their children are spending time and ask their children about these adults. You can read more about these allegations from the News Journal's website.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Football Season is back and with it comes arguments as to the best teams will be:  will Alabama's Nick Saban-led team continue its dynasty?  Will Baltimore repeat as Super Bowl Champions or will another team emerge victorious.  Alongside stories of quarterback controversies and big game match ups, is the recent news that a group of 4,500 former NFL players who filed a class action lawsuit against the NFL has settled with the league to the tune of $765 million.  That's a lot of money to be sure.  However, what's interesting about the settlement is that the NFL got away without admitting any fault on its part or that football was the cause of the plaintiffs' injuries.  Football was clearly the cause of the plantiffs' injuries - how else would otherwise healthy middle aged men experience severe memory loss and other ailments?

The NFL settlement doesn't end the matter either; as several former college players have recently filed lawsuits.  Football at the pro and collegiate level is a big-business.  The game is violent; something that everyone knows.  However, until recently professional and college football failed to take steps minimize risks associated with playing athletes who have already suffered concussions or trying to make helmets safer.

This settlement isn't the end of the story.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Delaware Supreme Court find that State police can be held liable for sexual misconduct of their officers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On September 12, 2013, the Delaware Supreme Court released its decision in Jane D.W. Doe v. State of Delaware. The issue before the Court was whether the State of Delaware could be held liable for the tortious acts (in this case a sexual assault) by an on-duty Delaware State Police Officer.

Under a theory known as respondeat superior a company or organization can be held liable for the torts that their employees do in the course of being an employee (e.g. a pizza delivery man rear-ends another car -the pizza company could be held liable for the accident the pizza delivery man caused since the accident happened in "the scope of employment").

The lower court, reasoning that sexual misconduct is not in job description of of a police officer, granted summary judgment in favor of the State Police.

Justice Berger writing for the Delaware Supreme Court reversed the lower court decision and clarified what respondeat superior means stating, "The relevant test, however, is not whether Giddings' [the police officer] was "'within the ordinary course of the [employer] ... but whether the service itself in which the tortious act was done was within the ordinary course of such business.' Stated differently, the test is whether the employee was acting in the ordinary course of business during the time frame within which the tort was committed." (Doe v. State, 2013 WL 5006496 * 2). The Court concluded that a jury could conclude that the defendant's actions were foreseeable. (Id.)

This case may prove to be very helpful in the understanding the meaning of respondeat superior in Delaware. At the very least, it is a win for those who are victims of individuals who abuse their positions of trust and authority.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On October 10, 2013 Judge Parkins of the Delaware Superior Court held in the attached ruling that plaintiff Jordan Waterhouse's claims, based on sexual abuse, which were not time-barred as of the enactment of the Child Victim's Act, 10 Del. C. 8145 on July 9, 2007, were actionable.  This was a great decision for Jordan and all survivors of childhood sexual abuse and we believe it correctly interpreted the Child Victim's Act and gave effect to its remedial intent.

		<title>Uninsured Motorist Bill becomes law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The practice of law is often affected by what happens at the state and federal level. New laws can have both a positive and negative effect on the rights of injured parties. Our firm is a member of both the national American Association of Justice (AAJ) and the Delaware Trial Lawyers Association (DTLA), which does vitally important lobbying work at the local, state, and federal level. For example, DTLA was recently instrumental in helping pass Delaware's new Uninsured Motorist Law.

As explained by DTLA, "
The underinsured motorist bill (Senate Bill 61) passed the Senate and the House last legislative session, and was signed into law by Governor Markell on July 3, 2013. This new law allows injured parties to pursue their UIM policies up to the extent of their damages (of course, only up to their UIM limits), regardless of the tortfeasor's bodily injury policy limits. In other words, UIM is "triggered" based on damages rather than "triggered" only if the injured party’s UIM policy limits are higher than the tortfeasor's bodily injury policy limits."

"For example, let’s assume that you are significantly injured in car accident, and the person responsible for the accident has $100,000 of bodily injury coverage. If you had $15,000, $25,000, $50,000, or $100,000 of underinsured motorist bodily injury coverage, your underinsured motorist benefits would be equal or less than the responsible party’s liability coverage, and your underinsured motorist coverage would not be “triggered” (and could not be tapped into, even if your injuries were deserving of more than the $100,000 of liability limits available). Under the new law, the underinsured motorist policy limits no longer have to be higher than the responsible party’s liability limits to be accessed. In the above example, you are now permitted to obtain the $100,000 of liability coverage, and also pursue your underinsured motorist policy up to the extent of your underinsured motorist policy limits (assuming that the damages are worth in excess of the liability limits)."

This new law will hopefully help protect Delaware drivers injured by uninsured drivers. This is just one of the countless ways, DTLA fights for Delawareans. Jacobs and Crumplar attorney, Elizabeth Lewis is on the Editorial Board of DTLA, and all attorneys of the firm are actively involved in DTLA and AAJ.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Legislation to Be Introduced to Limit Victim&#039;s Rights to Access to Courts</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Two pieces of legislation that will be going to a vote the week of November 11 could adversely affect victim’s rights.

<b>FACT.</b>   Asbestos companies and their supporters are using their political influence to pass a new bill in the U.S. House of Representatives.  The "Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act" (“FACT”) is going to a vote the week of November 11.  This bill will delay and, in some cases, deny justice and compensation to people suffering from asbestos-related diseases, such as mesothelioma, lung cancer, asbestosis, and pleural diseases, among other diseases. It is merely the latest attempt by asbestos corporate interests to avoid responsibility for their wrongdoings. There are already too many hurdles and impediments and delays in asbestos victims’ cases! More are not needed when these clients are suffering because some corporations chose to use a poisonous product rather than put consumers’ and employees’ health and safety before their corporate bottom line.

You can call your Representative and tell him or her to OPPOSE the bill, and ask your family and friends to do the same. Go to www.takejusticeback.com/asbestosaction to do this right now.

<b>LARA</b>.  H.R. 2655/S. 1288, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, known as LARA, would amend Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by replacing the current version of the Rule, which has been in effect since 1993, with the 1983 version of Rule 11.  LARA would increase litigation, unnecessarily meddle with the authority of the federal judiciary, and disproportionately affect plaintiffs, especially plaintiffs in civil rights cases.

Some of the most important changes in the LARA are:
<ul>
	<li>the elimination of Safe-harbor provision which protect against the imposition of sanction if the filing alleged to be sanctionable is withdrawn or corrected within 21 days.</li>
	<li>Sanctions, including attorneys’ fees and costs are to be paid to the party prevailing on the motion rather than the Court .</li>
</ul>
LARA will have the following effects:
<ul>
	<li>Encourages satellite litigation.  For the 10 years that mandatory sanctions were in effect, litigation surrounding Rule 11 significantly increased.  Any time a party filed a Rule 11 motion – because judges had no discretion and were forced to issue a sanction for even the smallest violation of the Rule - a countermotion would be immediately filed and a whole side or “satellite” litigation business erupted. Parties would be encouraged to litigate rather than resolve these issues.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Threatens an independent judiciary.  Since 1993, Rule 11 has been discretionary rather than mandatory.  Under current Rule 11, judges are able to use their discretion to assess the complex nature of a case, and evaluate potential violations of the rule and issue sanctions accordingly.  This appropriately leaves the determination of whether or not sanctions should be imposed for a violation of Rule 11 to the judges who hear the cases, and not Congress.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Jeopardizes civil rights cases.  Sanctions were more often imposed against plaintiffs than defendants and more often imposed against plaintiffs in certain kinds of cases, primarily in civil rights and certain kinds of discrimination cases. This may be because such cases are difficult to prove because people and institutions generally try to hide discriminatory or retaliatory motives, as they know the law does not allow such conduct.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Willl unfortunately encourage the use of Rule 11 as a litigation tactic to prevent all claims from proceeding, especially those that involve new legal issues, that are different from the “norm” or difficult to prove from being brought at all and thus lessen the public’s constitutional right to trial by jury.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

THESE BILLS SHOULD BE OPPOSED BY ANYONE WHO VALUES OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.  CONTACT YOUR REPRESENTATIVE TO DO SO!!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On November 18, 2013, Jacobs &amp; Crumplar secured a $2.4 million dollar verdict against Brother Damian Galligan, a religious brother of the Marist Brothers of the Schools, for plaintiff Brian Elliott, as reported in The News Journal and the AP, in the links below.  Plaintiff Brian Elliott was sexually abused in New York, New Jersey, and Delaware over a six year time frame,  from 1977-1983, when he was 8-14 years old.  Brian Elliott testified in his trial regarding the horrendous chilhood sexual abuse he suffered, as well as the effects of it that still haunt him today.  Psychiatrist Dr. Carol Tavani testified regarding Brian's damages as well.  Galligan did not attend the trial.  Brian thanked the Court, General Assembly, and the Jury for their part in enabling him to tell his story and have a measure of justice and resolution.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As reported in the Philadelphia Inquirer on December 27, 2013 Msgr. William Lynn who was serving a three to six year jail term for child-endangerment was released on  a technicality.  The Superior Court  panel, a Pennsylvania appellate court, held that the endangerment law in existence at the time Lynn permitted and enabled child abuser priests to remain in positions which gave them access to children, without warning to children or parents, only applied to people who directly supervised children.   Even  a member of Lynn's defense team told the Philadelphia Inquirer on December 27, 2013 that <strong>"Under the new [child endangerment law enacted in 2007] there was little douubt that Lynn potentially could have been held legally responsible for the actions of other priests."</strong>

If the Superior Court's interpretation of the law is correct, then this shows the need for strong laws to protect children such as that enacted in 2007, as well as the importance of civil actions.  In a civil action there is a lower burden of proof, preponderance of the evidence v. beyond a reasonable doubt, and there is less risk that an enabler will escape liability because of a technicality.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Chicago Diocese Covered Up Years of Abuse</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The cover-up.  Be it in politics or business, the problem of the cover-up is constant.  Admitting that you made a mistake and failed to stop bad behavior is such an easy thing to do; but so often, instead of admitting mistakes, people and organizations try and cover up their mistakes.   Recently in Chicago news broke that for decades the Catholic Diocese of Chicago hid evidence that many priests in its Diocese were abusing children.  March Pearlman, another attorney who has represented victims of sex abuse summed it up best when he said, "The issue is not when the abuse happened; the issue is what they did once it was reported."In Chicago Diocese officials did worst than do nothing, they covered up evidence and allowed sexual predators further opportunities to abuse children.  Sadly, what happened in Chicago also happened in countless other dioceses around the country including Wilmington where Jacobs &amp; Crumplar represented many individuals who were abused by priests employed by the Diocese of Wilmington. Jacobs &amp; Crumplar has fought and continues to fight to hold institutions accountable for their cover-ups.

You know, then goodell, as commissioner should know what's going on with every team, he's the commissioner. If he doesn't know what's going on, then he too should be fined and suspended for this to have happened on his watch. It goes both ways goodell. Unfortunately, goodell has never worked in a football organization. He has never been a coach. Has there ever been enough damage done to ruin a player's career? If not, then no harm, no foul. Penalize them financially and move one. Bounties have no place in any profession, but common on, to place blame on the coach; what if he honestly didn't know. How naive it is for goodell to assume and demand that coaches should.]]></wp:comment_content>

Today, as reported by Cris Barrish of The News Journal, WDEL, and other news media, Jacobs &amp; Crumplar filed suit  under the 2007 Child Victims Act in Sussex County Superior Court on behalf of plaintiffs Tracy Richard and her children for the sexual abuse inflicted upon them by their father Robert Richards IV. 

The lawsuit alleges that the Defendant is a diagnosed pedophile with a sexual disorder.  It alleges that in 2005 when his daughter was just three years old at the time of the childhood sexual abuse and that he also sexually abused her little brother who at the time was only 19 months old. 

This abuse of both of his children continued until 2007 when his daughter reported her abuse to her maternal grandmother.  After allegedly failing a lie detector test in 2008, the Defendant then pled guilty in Superior Court to one count of intentional rape in the 4<sup>th</sup> degree, sexual penetration of a victim less than 16, a felony.  He received no jail time at all for this felony conviction and instead was put on eight years probation and ordered to stay away from children. 

Furthermore, in 2010 the Defendant then admitted to the probation bureau that he believed he may have also had abused his son, Robert V.<b>  </b>No additional criminal proceedings were forthcoming even after these new revelations.The purpose of the lawsuit is to obtain adequate compensation and medical care for these two innocent little children for problems which will last their lifetimes.  In addition, it is hoped that their lawsuit will send a clear signal to child abusers and their enablers everywhere that such outrageous conduct will not be tolerated.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On April 2, 2014 former trial lawyer Senator Claire McCaskill questioned General Motors CEO Mary Barra at a hearing in the Senate's Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Insurance.

Sen. McCaskill explained that GM chose not to fix a defective ignition switch and as a result life was lost told the terrible story of a life that was lost

The only way to hold corporations accountable when they put profits over people, and government agencies when their systems fail to protect the public, is the civil justice system.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Smyrna High School teacher and coach Jennifer Suarez was charged Friday after investigators say she sexually abused a 17-year-old boy inside her classroom.  The News Journal reported the story here:

<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0066cc"><a href="http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/crime/2014/04/25/smyrna-teacher-charged-sexual-abuse-teen/8160081/">http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/crime/2014/04/25/smyrna-teacher-charged-sexual-abuse-teen/8160081/</a></span></span>

Smyrna High School teacher Donovan Garvin was arrested in January 2013 for sexually abusing a student in his classroom, as well.

Supervision of teachers is critical when child sexual abuse is as rampant as it is in public schools and other schools.  Unfortunately, sometimes people who are in child related professions are child abusers. You have to be on the lookout for signs and opportunities!!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If the allegations are true we have sadly more proof that childhood sex abuse involves all classes of society, the rich and poor the powerful and the weak are all involved. Once when I was interviewed for a nationally syndicated radio show I was asked why there were so many cases now ,was it that  society had gotten worse, I said no I thought the victims were now starting to fight back as finally society was paying attention.

I applaud this young man and his family. Taking on an alleged abuser who works for the Attorney General's office (the very office charged with prosecuting abuse )takes a  lot of courage. Although I have every confidence the AG's office will prosecute this case with vigor, some consideration should be given by the family and their supporters to hiring a private attorney. All too often victims of crime come to private civil attorneys only after they are disappointed with the results of the criminal proceedings. If they had retained the private civil attorney early on,that attorney could be advocating for the victim's rights during the entire criminal process. One often overlooked provision of criminal sentencing is "restitution." There is no reason why for instance a sentencing judge could not order the defendant as part of plea bargain to make certain payments to the victim.  Many civil attorneys would be willing to take on such a case on a contingent basis (being paid out of the restitution award or a subsequent civil suit)

It must be remembered the prosecutor represents the State and sometimes for various reasons they may not have the exact same interests as the victim-hence the need for the victim to have his or her own advocate.

		<title>Tower Hill , Salesianum and the Simmons Delaware AG Sex Case</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Let's hope there is finally some progress from institutions in reporting abuse and in  supporting the victim. According to the  News Journal it was someone from Salesianum, the victims's school, who reported the crime. If so, one must assume a that all the prior abuse scandals and lawsuits that surrounded that school have finally made a difference. I wonder, however, if Tower Hill  gets it. In its recent letter to the parents about the latest case of abuse by someone associated with Tower Hill, the school notes as of yet none of the victims are associated with Tower Hill- only the abusers.
 Sexual Abuse of Children is everyone's problem and everyone must do their part to maintain a policy of zero tolerance. If Simmons is guilty, and according to the press account he has confessed, I would hope he is appropriately punished. Lawyers have a special responsibility to obey the law and prosecutors even more so. Finally we can never forget the victim or victims he must be adequately compensated and protected..]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Vatican /Delucca and the Defrocking of Priests for Child Sex Abuse</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Vatican with great fanfare has bragged about all the priests they have defrocked for the abuse of the children of the Church. Much more has to be done by the Church before the problem of Priest preying on the children is solved. The Church must adopt a stringent policy of zero tolerance. 

Defrocking is a powerful deterrent to most priests as it threatens their entire identity. Because it is so important to the priest there is a detailed process the Church has to go through if the Priest contests it. But like anything else if the Church really wants someone defrocked it can move quickly

A case in point in the  case involving the infamous Francis Delucca a Delaware priest who had abused over 30p boys. After he was caught abusing his great nephew and sent to prison the Church finally started defrocking proceedings. These were moving very slowly until trial against the Wilmington Diocese for its grossly negligent handling of Delucca was set to begin and PRESTO out of nowhere there is a big press announcement timed on the eve of trial that the Vatican had now defrocked Delucca and  that he was no longer a priest etc.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Yes, much more must be done as these 800 priests are more than likely just a drop in the bucket!  Crimes against children are so heinous that accused pedophiles like priests, Sylvain Kustyan, Jerry Sandusky, etc. And THEIR ENABLERS, must be apprehended before they have years to continue to destroy young lives. Sandusky is now safely behind bars. But unfortunately, Kustyan, who has been formally charged with two counts each of 1st Degree Sodomy and Sexual Abuse of a ten-year-old little boy, fled to avoid imminent arrest. Kustyan, formerly of Tuscaloosa, Alabama and Hermin/ Mazingarbe, France, as an English teacher, has led numerous groups of schoolchildren on trips to the US, the UK and Ireland.. Pedophiles condemn their victims to a lifetime of emotional and psychological trauma and often permanent physical ailments as well. Since the average pedophile has 300 different victims in their lifetime and since the recidivism rate among pedophiles is virtually 100% and since there is no effective treatment and no known cure they must be stopped ASAP!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Teacher Resigns Amid Allegations of Sex Abuse - Then Lands Another Teaching Job</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As reported in The Philadelphia Inquirer, May 20, 2014, a Delaware County school teacher named Edgar Friedrichs was allowed to quietly resign when he was alleged to have molested and raped his students.  He received a fair recommendation from his school, Interboro School District, which did not advise that he had resigned because of allegations of sexual abuse or mention anything regarding the sexual abuse claims.  Using that recommendation, he landed another teaching job in Fayette County, West Virginia, eventually becoming the principal of an elementary school.  In 1997 a 12 year old boy was found dead in Friedrichs' cabin during a fishing trip.  Ultimately he was convicted of this young boy's murder as well as the sexual abuse of two of his other students in West Virginia.

Jacobs &amp; Crumplar recently filed suit on behalf of a student victim of sexual abuse, against Smyrna School District and Donovan Garvin, the victim's former teacher.  Garvin was arrested and charged with ten counts of first degree sexual abuse of a child by a person of trust and one count of sexual solicitation of a child under the age of 18 to engage in a prohibited act. Garvin pled guilty to sexual abuse by a person in a position of trust or authority, first degree, in the Superior Court for the State of Delaware in and for Kent County.  During Garvin’s sentencing on August 28, 2013 the deputy attorney general informed the Court that Garvin was let go by other school districts for other allegations of inappropriate sexual contact with students.

We have to ensure that teachers who sexually abuse students are not allowed to simply escape to a new location and continue abusing students.  We support even stronger laws regarding background and reference checks for teachers.  It is usually the administrators who do reference checks and they need to do a better job!

There have been a lot of changes in the Delaware judiciary this year.

In February of 2014, <a title="Leo E. Strine" href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10861/StrineJr">Leo E. Strine, Jr</a>. was sworn in as Chief Justice of the Delaware Supreme Court. He replaced Chief Justice Myron Steele. Prior to his appointment, Chief Justice Strine sat as a Vice Chancellor on the Court of Chancery since 1998 and as Chancellor since 2011.

Effective July 1, 2014, <a title="Leonard P. Stark" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_P._Stark">Leonard Stark</a> replaced retiring Chief Judge Gregory Sleet, who had served in that position since 2007. Stark served as a United States Magistrate Judge from 2007-2010 and a District Court Judge from 2010-2014.

Chief Judge of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, Kevin Gross has also retired. His successor is <a title="Brendan L. Shannon" href="http://law.widener.edu/Academics/Faculty/ProfilesDeAdj/ShannonBrendan.aspx">Judge Brendan L. Shannon</a>. Shannon has served as a judge on the Bankruptcy Court since 2006.

In April, <a title="Andre Bouchard" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/03/20/trial-lawyer-nominated-to-lead-delaware-chancery-court/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0">Andre Bouchard was confirmed</a> as by the Delaware Senate as Chancellor of the Delaware Court of Chancery.

Bouchard will replace former Chancellor Leo E. Strine, Jr. who now serves as Chief Justice of the Delaware Supreme Court. Prior to his appointment, Bouchard practiced at Bouchard, Margules &amp; Friedlander in Wilmington, Delaware.

In June, <a title="Karen Valihura" href="http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202660846540/Valihura-Confirmed-to-Del-Supreme-Court?slreturn=20140623151928">Karen L. Valihura</a> was nominated by Governor Jack Market to fill the Delaware Supreme Court seat being vacated by Justice Jack B. Jacobs, who retired on June 24, 2014.

		<title>Ask A Lawyer: Is if Legal To Fire An Employee Who Is Pregnant?</title>

This week's "Ask A Lawyer" question deals with <a href="http://jcdelaw.com/employment-law/" title="employment law">employment law</a> and discrimination.

<strong>It is illegal to discriminate against an employee because she is pregnant or for any pregnancy related condition.  </strong>

If you are pregnant and you experience and adverse incident at work, such as suspension without pay or firing, you should contact a lawyer.  

Particularly important is the time between when the employer learns of your pregnancy or pregnancy related condition and the time of the adverse action it takes against you – the closer in time the two are, the more likely the employer is taking the action because of your pregnancy.  

If the employer gives a reason and the reason does not make any sense and seems contrary to reality then that is another factor making it more likely that the employer is taking the action because of your pregnancy.  

For example, if the employer says he is firing you because you miss too much time, and you have a perfect attendance record, then the claimed reason is likely a pretext for illegal discrimination.  

If you are concerned that an employer has discriminated or retaliated against you because you are pregnant, <a href="http://jcdelaw.com/attorneys/" title="Delaware Attorneys">consult a lawyer right away</a>, as the time for making claims is limited under the law.  Acting quickly is always the best route.

		<title>Could Obamacare Cause A Rise in Medical Malpractice Claims?</title>
		<link>http://localhost/plm/blog/2014/07/30/medical-malpractice-obamacare/</link>
		<pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2014 13:39:43 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Affordable Care Act has been in the news for several years now: First a key piece of legislation of then candidate Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, the Act was signed into law after President Obama took office over the objections from Republicans. 

<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/medical-malpractice.jpg" alt="medical-malpractice" width="600" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-836" />

Then the constitutionality of the Act was challenged in by several states and conservative organizations and was then challenged by several states and Conservative organizations in federal court. 

In the summer of 2013, the central portions of the Act (popularly called “Obamacare” ) were upheld, although challenges to its implementation still remain.

If Obamacare remains the law of the land, more people will be entering the healthcare market. While this means more people will be seeing doctors and receiving treatment, which is a good thing, it will very likely result in an increase in medical malpractice claims as indicated in a piece in the Insurance Journal entitled, <a href="http://www.insurancejournal.com/magazines/features/2014/06/16/331904.htm" title="Obamacare Challenging Medical Malpractice">“How Healthcare Reform is Challenging Medical Malpractice.”</a> 

For example, through early April of this year, seven to eight million Americans had signed up for healthcare insurance and about 25% of them had never had insurance before.  Within a few years that number will be about 22 million.

Along this record number of new people seeing doctors will undoubtedly come more <a href="http://jcdelaw.com/medical-malpractice/" title="Medical Malpractice">medical practice</a> claims. 

Part of the problem may be that many individuals will no longer just see one doctor who diagnose him or her and treats him or her, but several different doctors — meaning there is no continuity of care. This could lead not only to the de-personalization of medical care, but also an increase in the number of medical malpractice claims.

Lawyers, patients, and individuals need to be aware of all this.  While there may be an increase in the number of “claims” of medical malpractice this does not necessarily mean that actual medical malpractice has occurred under the law. 

<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/injured-plantiff.jpg" alt="injured-plantiff" width="1000" height="667" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-841" />

Patients and would-be plaintiffs need to be aware that it will still be very difficult to successfully demonstrate that medical malpractice occurred: an opinion will still be needed from another doctor that the doctor-in-question who committed malpractice, did, in fact, commit medical malpractice. 

The Insurance Journal makes it seem that medical malpractice could be the next “asbestos.” Although it might be too early to tell, I’d doubt it for a couple of reasons. First, asbestos litigation dealt with decades-long industry wide experience involving countless different companies, while a medical malpractice claim involves (generally) one doctor and one hospital. 

Even if liability were spread to several doctors and hospitals, it’s doubtful that it would become as big an issue as the article suggests.

At the same time, individuals need to know that there are lawyers who will take on and try medical malpractice cases. Lawyers need to be aware the Obamacare will likely result in an increase number of inquiries from possible plaintiffs and need to be able to determine the likelihood that negligence was in fact committed. 

Additionally, lawyers need to be aware that there may very well likely be several individuals who need to be sued, not just one individual doctor.  Regardless, it will be interesting to see how Obamacare will affect the medical malpractice cases in the years to come.

		<title>Delaware’s Child Victim’s Act: A Resounding Success but More Still Needs to be Done</title>
		<link>http://localhost/plm/blog/2014/08/13/delawares-child-victims-act/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-872" src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/tom-crumplar.jpg" alt="tom-crumplar" width="680" height="453" />

After decades of sweeping the problem under the rug, Americans are now facing the grim reality of the immense cost of <a href="http://jcdelaw.com/sexual-abuse/history-sexual-abuse-litigation/">childhood sexual abuse</a>. As hard as it is to believe, the most reliable studies show that one out of every four girls and one out of six boys are sexually abused before they reach age 18.

This abuse not only scars the soul but leads to lifelong problems with addiction, personal relationships, and far too often crime.

Seven years ago, Delaware became a model for the rest of the United States when it adopted the <a href="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/7-_-8145-Civil-suits-for-damages-based-upon-sexual-abuse-of-a-minor-by-an-adult.pdf">Child Victim’s Act</a>.

This law abolished the harsh two year deadline to file a childhood sex abuse case. The lawsuits which were then filed show that sex offenders come from all walks of life: a state court judge, a famous high school football coach, a disc jockey, an OB/GYN doctor, a teacher’s aide, a public school principal, a Boy Scout leader, and dozens of revered Catholic priests.

The silent victims were people we come in contact with every day – policemen, lawyers, insurance agents, sales clerks, bus drivers, plumbers, and the little boy down the street.

Far too often, people forget that the civil tort system can be a powerful means of protecting society’s interest. Often it is very difficult, if not impossible for the criminal justice system to punish a sex offender.

Not only does the prosecution have to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt, but there are numerous other obstacles that must be overcome before there is a conviction. With the Child Victim’s Act, Delaware has added a powerful tool to deter and punish sex offenders.

It is noteworthy that very few of the sex abusers who were successfully sued under the Act were ever punished, much less prosecuted under our criminal system.

While Delaware’s Child Victim’s Act was a major step forward, more needs to be done. It is my hope that in the next legislative session that the General Assembly will consider the following reforms:
<ul>
	<li>Remove the current special protection Delaware public schools have that allows them to negligently hire, retain and harbor sexual offenders.At present a private school, whether secular or parochial, can be held liable for its negligence, while the public school down the street gets off. This double standard must end. Our children in public schools deserve the same protection as a private school student.</li>
	<li>Across America in the federal courts, thanks to then-Senator Joe Biden’s signature legislation, the Violence Against Women Act, evidence can be introduced about the defendant’s prior sexual misconduct whereas in a Delaware state court this evidence often cannot be used.</li>
	<li>John Doe Filing. In today’s computer age, anyone can go on the public docket and learn the identity and other personal information about these scarred victims, even if they are minors. Right now it is within the complete discretion of the Judge to prevent a sexual abuse victim from filing a John Doe case.</li>
</ul>
Delaware should allow victims to freely file as John or Jane Doe, something that would not only encourage people coming forward but would also minimize further injury and embarrassment to those already scarred young children.

Finally, while the money obtained in a civil lawsuit is important, especially to get much needed medical care and to compensate a victim for a lifetime of loss, often the most important thing is that the victim is finally able to confront his abuser. For the first time in his life, it is the victim who has the power over the abuser and not the other way around.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>NCAA Reduces Sexual Abuse Sanctions on Penn State</title>

NCAA sanctions imposed on Penn State for its role in enabling childhood sexual abuse to happen by its employee Jerry Sandusky <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/09/09/346999107/ncaa-lifts-penn-states-postseason-ban-restores-scholarships">were reduced on Monday</a>. Based on a progress report and recommendations made by former Sen. George Mitchell the NCAA has reduced several sanctions.  

Before the announcement, Penn State would have had only 65 scholarships this season, 80 scholarships next season and a full 85 in 2016. They also wouldn't have been eligible for the postseason until 2016. Now, Penn State can play in a bowl this season and will see its scholarship limit improve to 75 this season and return to 85 in time for next season.  

Penn State must pay a $60 million dollars, 112 wins still forfeited, and monitoring will continue. 

The claimed reason for these reductions is that Penn State is making great progress in complying with recommendations for an improved environment for making the program safer.   

This overlooks the fact that the sanctions were issued in July 2012 for Penn State's past conduct in failing to report child abuse occurring in its property and covering up for their child abusing employee.  

Penn State was wrong and deserved to be punished. Yes time has passed but the survivors of its negligence have to live with the devastation of sexual abuse for their entire lives. 

Penn State should not get a reprieve for doing things it should have done so many years ago - ensuring that sexual abuse and abusers are not tolerated and making sure that the reporting of child abuse and abusers and the protecting of children is of the hignest priority, instead of its football program.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Medical Budget Cuts Mean Less Care For Our Loved Ones</title>

With our aging population and the <a href="http://leeorbronis.com/2014/04/14/the-dangers-of-nursing-home-understaffing/">attempt by medical providing agencies such as the VA and Medicaid/Medicare to limit expenses</a> by under-staffing hospitals and nursing facilities, more and more patients are being mistreated. This applies to seniors but also to anyone who seeks long term care from such agencies. In addition, private nursing facilities also limit care to cut expenses.

Thus, when your loved one is placed in such a situation you need to be very observant and watch carefully the services provided. They should not be overmedicated to make them lay or sit all day. This leads to mental deterioration and physical deterioration. 

Bed sores are the number one problem due to the concept of the medical facilities being a storage place rather than a place for treatment and care. 

Do not sit by and allow your loved one to be vegetated; insist on physical activity and if the facility does not have exercise bicycles or tread mills make sure they are provided. If not, you must walk your loved one around the halls or make them wheel their chairs. 

If the lack of care causes deterioration, physical or mental, then you must decide if the care is so bad that the deterioration is a result of below-standard care. 

We have successfully represented families with such concerns against these institutions, government or private, to help your loved one get proper treatment or compensation for mistreatment. 

Patients need protection; make sure your loved ones are protected. Contact Jacobs &amp; Crumplar today. ]]></content:encoded>

		<title>N.J. Diocese Pays $610K to Settle Claim it Allowed Sexually Abusive Priest to Remain in Ministry</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In what is believed to be one of New Jersey’s largest individual settlements involving sexual abuse by a priest, the Diocese of Trenton has paid $610,000 to a Burlington County man who was molested for more than a decade by the former head of the diocese’s youth group.

Jacobs &amp; Crumplar attorney Raeann Warner, who represented the victim, had this to say regarding the case:

<blockquote>“I’m happy for Chris that he has gotten some measure of justice.  I’m thankful to New Jersey for having excellent Judges and fair case law which allowed this case to be brought.  But Chris’s case could only be brought because Chris had repressed memories.  

There are many survivors in New Jersey who do not have access to justice because of the rigid statute of limitations that was in place when they were hurt as children.  I hope New Jersey will pass a civil window which will allow time-barred claims to be brought and allow many other survivors, even those who have always remembered the abuse, to have some measure of justice.”</blockquote>

		<title>Children are the Victims, Not the Pedophiles Who Abused Them</title>
		<link>http://localhost/plm/blog/2014/10/07/children-are-victims/</link>

Margo Kaplan's article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/opinion/pedophilia-a-disorder-not-a-crime.html">recent NY Times article</a> is an interesting, but somewhat disturbing, read. She makes the point that being a pedophile is different than acting upon it.  

The author claims "Without legal protection, a pedophile cannot risk seeking treatment or disclosing his status to anyone for support. He could lose his job, and future job prospects, if he is seen at a group-therapy session, asks for a reasonable accommodation to take medication or see a psychiatrist, or requests a limit in his interaction with children."  

This is wrong and disturbing on a number of levels.  First, consultation with a doctor/psychologist/psychiatrist and/or lawyer is confidential and the pedophile's identity cannot be disclosed.  So the pedophile does have legal protection to allow him to seek treatment and disclose his status. 

Second, he can take medication or see a psychiatrist on his own time.  Third, his job duties should never include "interaction with children" at all. 

The article blames society, in part, for pedophiles acting out.  If a pedophile chooses to act out, he has no one to blame but himself.  Childhood sexual abuse is a scourge on our country - the headlines continue day after day despite increased criminal and civil penalties.   

We should always err on the side of protecting vulnerable, innocent children from pedophiles.]]></content:encoded>

On October 15, 2014, Jacobs &amp; Crumplar attorney Raeann Warner was appointed to serve on the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the <a href="http://www.deb.uscourts.gov/recently-filed-chapter-1115s">Reichhold Holdings, US, Inc. Bankruptcy</a> on behalf of her client.  

Her clients, all asbestos claimants, had sued Reichhold Inc. due to exposure from its asbestos, and were set to go to trial in November 2014 before Reichhold filed for bankruptcy protection on September 30, 2014.

Reichhold is one of the world's largest suppliers of unsaturated polyester resins for composites and a leading supplier of coating resins for a wide variety of markets and applications.  

<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Reichold.jpg" alt="Reichold" width="200" height="285" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1193" />

At least prior to January 1980 it manufactured an asbestos-containing phenolic molding compound and supplied it to various plants where molded products were manufactured.   

Some workers exposed to this asbestos containing product during the manufacturing process  have claimed it caused them asbestos -related injuries including mesothelioma and lung cancer.]]></content:encoded>

In an article by <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/how-safe-artificial-turf-your-child-plays-n220166">Hannah Rappleye of NBC</a>, the potentially fatal hazards of crumb rubber artificial turf are discussed.

A number of former goalies and soccer players have developed blood cancers or other types of cancer. Players - and goalies in particular - are exposed to the crumb rubber turf particles which become disturbed during play and get into their clothes, hair, and mouths.

The components of this turf which can contain benzene, carbon black and lead, and other potentially harmful chemicals and carcinogens.

What is clear from the article is that more testing needs to be done to make sure this turf is safe to play on for children and teenagers and not causing them to develop cancer.

<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/artificial-turf.jpg" alt="artificial-turf" width="310" height="233" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1211" /><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2265067/">Artificial turf was co-invented by employees of the Monsanto Company</a>, Donald L. Elbert, James M. Faria, and Robert T. Wright, under the name Chemgrass as a way for children to play outdoors where grass was limited. 

In 1964, the Moses Brown School in Providence, Rhode Island became one of the first institutions to install artificial turf.

However, it was in 1966 that Chemgrass took over the world of sports.

After the Houston Astros had completed their first season in the first-ever domed stadium, it was apparent that natural grass could not survive due to the lack of sunlight. Because of this dilemma, the AstroDome turned to artificial grass. The name of the material was then quickly renamed to AstroTurf.

AstroTurf became a popular fixture in the stadiums of professional sports organizations throughout the 1970s and 1980s. By 1988, however, a backlash began to develop. The English Football Association banned the material because it caused more injuries because the material was harder than natural grass. A 1995 poll conducted by the National Football League Players Association discovered that 93% of players believed playing on AstroTurf increased the chance of injury.

As a result, many stadiums began to switch back to natural grass -  such as the original Giants Stadium which had previously used artificial turf since it’s opening in 1976. By 2013, every Major League Baseball, with the exception of two teams, <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/sep/11/sports/la-sp-0912-baseball-astro-turf-20130912">had all but eliminated AstroTurf</a>.

With advancements in technology, companies found a way to improve artificial grass. One of the most popular forms is synthetic turf. This material, which is composed of synthetic fibers and tire scraps, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/22/sports/soccer/22iht-ARENA.html?pagewanted=all">is now being supported</a> by the NFL, FIFA, Union of European Football Associations, recreational parks and on the fields of high schools across the county. In the United State alone, there are 11,000 fields containing synthetic turf.

<b>What is Synthetic Turf?</b>

According to the <a href="http://www.syntheticturfcouncil.org/?page=FAQs">Synthetic Turf Council</a>, this is the latest generation of synthetic turf that features “a grass-like ground cover that replicates lush natural grass in appearance and function. When used on athletic fields, it provides a consistent year-round, all-weather playing surface built to withstand extended use without downtime for recovery. 

As a landscape cover, synthetic turf provides a low maintenance, weed-free surface that doesn't need to be watered or fertilized, and is available in styles that look like the grass types that are prevalent locally.”

Synthetic turf typically include a drainage layer, a multi-layered backing system, and resilient "grass" blades. These “grass” blades have infilled with a granular filler which is meant to resemble natural turf. The Synthetic Turf Council describes "infilled" as a process where “the man-made grass blades are interspersed with a topsoil created with sand and/or granulated recycled tire rubber or other infill materials that provide the necessary stability, uniformity, and resiliency. 

Each blade customarily stands above the infill material. The typical blade length and system characteristics are determined by the specific activity requirements. In some applications, the synthetic turf system includes a pad or elastic layer underneath the turf, often in combination with lower pile height and less infill.”

<b>What Are the Health Concerns?</b>

Prior to the incredibly detailed NBC News article by Hannah Rappleye, there were some concerns over people being exposed to ground-up recycled tires (“tire crumbs”). The <a href="http://www.ehhi.org/reports/turf/">Environment and Human Health, Inc.</a> 

(EHHI) began receiving inquiries regarding “children’s exposures to ground-up rubber tires that are the in-fill material in the new synthetic turf fields” in 2007. The reason for these queries is that tire crumb contains the following toxic materials, according the <a href="http://www.njwec.org/PDF/Factsheets/fact-artificialterf.pdf">New Jersey Work Environment Council</a> (NJWEC):
<ul>
	<li>Toxic metals including zinc, lead, arsenic, cadmium, and chromium which have many harmful effects on humans and the environment.</li>
	<li>Carcinogens including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).</li>
	<li>Latex and other rubbers which can cause allergic reactions.</li>
	<li>Phthalates which have adverse effects on the reproductive organs, lungs, kidneys and liver.</li>
</ul>
The EHHI notes that exposure to these materials from workers in the rubber fabrication industry and in the rubber reclamation industry have resulted in “a spectrum of health effects, ranging from severe skin, eye, and respiratory irritation to three forms of cancer”

The NJWEC went as far to advise in 2008 that because of issues of “toxicity, movement, heat, cost, friction, sanitation, lifespan, maintenance, warranty, disposal costs, odor, loss of habitat, combustibility, should be thoroughly addressed before any decision to purchase is made. The community should carefully consider all the options including natural grass.”

Despite these concerns, there has been little research to prove otherwise. In fact, the Synthetic Turf Council claims that there have been over 75 independent and credible studies, including those from the EPA, that have “validated the safety of synthetic turf.” The EPA Study from December 2009 stated that “the health risks from inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact with synthetic turf and crumb rubber found every test result to be "below levels of concern.”

If research has been unable to discover any health risks involved with playing on synthetic turf, then how does that explain the fact that soccer coach Amy Griffin has been able to list 38 American soccer players - 34 of which are goaltenders - who have been diagnosed with cancer?

The NBC News article quotes Dr. Joel Forman, associate professor of pediatrics and preventive medicine at New York’s Mt. Sinai Hospital, who stated:

“None of [the studies] are long term, they rarely involve very young children and they only look for concentrations of chemicals and compare it to some sort of standard for what’s considered acceptable,” said Dr. Forman. “That doesn’t really take into account sub-clinical effects, long-term effects, the developing brain and developing kids.”

Furthermore, there haven’t been many studies that have focused on “whether ingesting the particles by mouth or absorbing them into the body through cuts and scrapes is dangerous.” Both of these scenarios are unique for athletes such as goalies.

<b>Conclusion</b>

The discussion regarding the safety the artificial turf has been raised for several years. In fact, New York State Assembly member Steve Englebright released a statement on November 5, 2007 that read:

“Before we take risks with our children’s health and drinking water quality, we need to make sure that the uncertainties . . . are fully investigated.”

In 2014, similar sentiment has been echoed by the likes of Dr. Joel Freeman. “Turf fields come with a number of real risks and a number of real benefits, who also added, “And every community … has to kind of weigh the different risks and benefits.”

		<title>Molly Shattuck and the Double Standard of Rape</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The recent <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/wp/2014/11/05/former-ravens-cheerleader-molly-shattuck-arrested-charged-with-rape-of-teen/" title="Molly Shattuck sexual abuse">press coverage of a rape of a 15 year old boy</a> by an attractive 47 year ex Baltimore Raven Cheerleader sadly should remind all of us the rape is truly gender neutral and the all too present double standard the excuse the rape of boys by women.

<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/shadow-boy.jpg" alt="shadow-boy" width="615" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1225" />
 
In many states (including Delaware) it was not until the 1970s that the crime of rape was even defined to include a woman sexually abusing a young boy.
 
Medical studies have shown the boys just as girls will suffer for the rest of their lives as result of this sexual abuse. Boys in some ways may have it even harder but society far too often has a double standard.  

If the story in the paper had a been about a 47 year old man who had been Baltimore Raven’s football player and who had sex with a 15 year girl everyone would be outraged and want to send him to straight to prison.
 
In the case involving <a href="http://jcdelaw.com/sexual-abuse/" title="sexual abuse">sexual abuse</a> between Molly Shattuck and the young male victim, I am sure many of the victims friends and classmates are congratulating him for “scoring “ with a “hot woman”, not realizing the power imbalance and the lifetime of scars the sex will cause.
 
I can only hope this young victim will get the best possible help.  I have had the honor and privilege of representing a number of boys who were abused by powerful women and I can tell you it is very difficult for them to come forward. 

I would encourage him and others in a similar situation to not simply rely on the prosecuting attorney. The State prosecutor represents the State not the victim. 

There are things a good civil lawyer can do even during the criminal proceeding to protect the victim, including asking the Court to make as part of any sentencing the requirement that the victim’s medical and counseling expense be paid by the abuser and that this be part of any sentence.
 
One final note from the sports world -one of my heroes growing up was Mickey Mantle, the Hall of Fame New York Yankee baseball player. His career and his life was cut short due to decades of hard partying. I recently found out why - he was abused as a boy by several older women, and this caused a lasting perverse effect on him.

		<title>Fraud: The Code Word of Asbestos Companies</title>
		<link>http://localhost/plm/blog/2014/11/07/fraud-code-word-asbestos-companies/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Wall Street Journal as well as the New York Times business writer, Joe Nocera, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/14/opinion/nocera-the-asbestos-scam-part-2.html?_r=0">have hailed the decision of Judge George Hodges of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court</a> for the Western District of North Carolina, for exposing the supposed fraud of the asbestos bankruptcies and law suits. 

<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/garlock.png" alt="garlock" width="760" height="376" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1233" />

This arose as a result of the bankruptcy of Garlock, Inc. and its protestation that it does not deserve to have to pay out enormous amounts to protect the individuals who have cancer and lung disorders from exposure to Garlock’s asbestos products. 

Unfortunately Judge Hodges seems to have bought the same argument that hundreds of state civil courts have rejected; that the <a href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/litigation/b/litigation-blog/archive/2014/01/13/bankruptcy-judge-plaintiffs-lawyers-covered-up-evidence-in-garlock-mesothelioma-cases.aspx">asbestos products of Garlock were not really dangerous</a>. It is unfortunate that the desire to protect the rights of the injured from being dragged through the mud in in a court meant to protect business has resulted in the controversy in North Carolina.

First, when a person who has or had asbestos disease files a lawsuit, that suit names a number of companies to achieve full redress from the purveyors of this toxic material. It was actually the companies themselves which caused the adding of every possibly liable company to a suit as if all asbestos product manufacturers were not sued, the ones sued would try to blame others not named. Thus the need to join all manufacturers was REQUIRED.

The success of proving that the asbestos product manufacturers were responsible took over twenty years despite continued lying by the asbestos companies, just as cigarette manufactures lied for over 30 years about the dangers of their products. 

After claimants repeatedly proved the liability of the asbestos companies, the companies filed for bankruptcy under the corporate friendly laws of the bankruptcy courts. As more and more claimants with asbestos diseases filed cases, large sums were put into trust to pay those injured parties some minimum compensation. 

These company trusts usually paid out between 1 and 10 percent of the amounts that the particular company had paid in state court trials. Remember, the amount each paid in state court trials was NOT the full amount of the compensation to the dead, dying and injured. It was only their share under state law. This was not double dipping; it was only forcing each company to contribute its fair share.

When bankruptcy courts allowed companies to pay only pennies on the dollar the remaining defendants, UNDER THE LAW OF ALL 50 STATES, had to pay more to properly pay the injured. This is what led Garlock to file its bankruptcy. The North Carolina bankruptcy court calls foul if the lawyers for the injured did not want to divulge each and every amount received from other bankruptcy estates in estimating Garlock’s liability. 

However the liability of Garlock depended on its settlements and court verdicts before it fled the state justice system. If Judge Hodges had reviewed the court dockets of the state courts that oversaw the litigation, he would have seen that the number of bankruptcy claims filed by an injured plaintiff had to be revealed and the amount received from each reported to a judge when a judgment was entered against any defendant in a case. Thus the transparency existed and exists today. To call this fraud is to ignore the safeguards in the state civil system.

It is because of this that when any person reads about "fraud" they need to understand that is a code word of asbestos company defendants to try and avoid paying fair compensation, and I am sorry to say, the misconceptions of judges who ignore the real victims: the sick and dying from exposure to asbestos.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>L.A. Teacher Sexual Abuse Settlement Could Not Have Happened Without The Work of Investigating Attorneys</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As <a href="http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/dollar139m-deal-reached-in-school-sex-abuse-case/ar-BBf5EMy" title="sexual abuse settlement">reported by the Associated Press</a> on November 21, 2014, a settlement of $139 million dollars was announced by attorneys representing 81 students from Los Angeles' Unified School District.  

<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ca-abuse-settlement.png" alt="ca-abuse-settlement" width="689" height="433" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1240" />

The settlement ended litigation against the school district because of its employment and supervision of Miramonte Elementary School teacher Mark Berndt, who was arrested in 2012 and accused of blindfolding students and feeding them cookies with his semen on them.  

The plaintiffs had evidence that the school district was aware for THREE DECADES of sexual misconduct by this teacher and took no action to protect students. These students were desperately in need of protection as the AP reported that "Parents had been hesitant to complain about Berndt because of a deep respect for teachers, and they were reluctant to cooperate with police because many feared deportation." 

The victims’ attorneys uncovered at least 12 incidents of sexual misconduct reported to the school and/or witnessed by school employees between 1983 and 2009 despite child abuse records having been purged by the school district.  The incidents were all of a similar nature involving Berndt exposing himself and acting in a sexually suggestive manner.  

What is appalling to the reader of this story is the number of years this man was employed and the failure of this school to take any action to protect these elementary school students from him when they received repeated, and similar, complaints. The School District has done an investigation and evaluation of its policies concerning sexually abusive teachers and claims this would not happen again - but 2009 was only five years ago and any reasonable school district would have been aware of the problem of sexual abuse by teachers as almost every day in the news there are reports of sexual abuse of students at public schools as well as other schools or churches. 

You have to wonder what could have possibly caused this school district to have its head in the sand.  The hope is that this lawsuit and the money the School District had to pay have finally caused it to wake up and make protection of students the priority that they should have always been entitled to.  

Again, this is the power of civil lawsuits - to uncover enabling institutions and expose their negligence acts as a vehicle for change.  Unfortunately the change comes in this case after over a hundred students have apparently been abused and had their childhoods forever ruined, negatively impacting the rest of their lives.

		<title>Xarelto Lawsuits Show Connection to Risk of Internal Bleeding</title>

&nbsp;

Plaintiff lawyers are actively pursuing the causal connection between the use of the anticoagulant prescription medication Xarelto (Rivaroxaban) and severe internal bleeding.

Lawsuits filed against Xarelto allege that Xarelto manufacturers failed to warn or failed to adequately warn patients and doctors of the increased risks of internal bleeding when using Xarelto.

&nbsp;

Xarelto is an anticoagulant (or blood thinner) manufactured and marketed in the US by Bayer and Janssen Pharmaceutical that has been prescribed to patients with atrial fibrillation; pulmonary embolism; deep vein thrombosis; stroke; and patients who have recently undergone a knee or hip replacement surgery, as an alternative to Warfarin (Coumadin).

The most dangerous potential side effect is severe internal bleeding that lead to death. There is no known cure for this bleeding caused by Xarelto.
Other injuries that can be caused through the use of Xarelto include blood clots, hematoma, and other serious injuries.
If you are currently taking Xarelto, call your doctor immediately if you sustain any type of injuries.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1280" src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Xarelto-pills.jpg" alt="Xarelto pills" width="300" height="225" />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Administrative Judge Kevin M. Dougherty signed an Order docketed on January 20, 2015, creating a <a href="http://pennrecord.com/news/15536-philadelphia-court-establishes-xarelto-mass-tort-docket" title="xarelto mass tort program">Xarelto Litigation Mass Tort Program </a>in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas.

As such, all pending and subsequently filed cases will be transferred to the Court’s Complex Litigation Center for coordination.  Case Management Order No. 1 is expected to be issued shortly.  

Presently, there are approximately 75 cases filed in Philadelphia County against various Johnson &amp; Johnson entities, Janssen entities and Bayer entities.  

These, and related entities, are responsible for the development, manufacturing, marketing and sales of <a href="http://jcdelaw.com/xarelto-lawsuits/" title="Have You Experienced Harmful Side Effects From the Medication Xarelto?">Xarelto</a> – a novel oral anticoagulant (“NOAC”), with over $2 billion dollars in sales nationwide, as well as allegations that it is responsible for thousands of negligently caused injuries.  

Lawsuit filings in Philadelphia County are expected to substantially increase.  ]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Sheldon Silver Corruption Case Unfairly Maligns Mesothelioma Research</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On January 24th, the New York Times published a lengthy article about the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/nyregion/sheldon-silvers-link-to-a-bonanza-and-a-cancer.html">corruption case against Sheldon Silver</a>, a high ranking member of the New York Legislature and an attorney. 

<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/sheldon-silver-1024x608.png" alt="sheldon-silver" width="1024" height="608" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1422" />

The case is focused on an arrangement where Mr. Silver directed public money and grants to a mesothelioma research facility in exchange for mesothelioma cases which he and his firm, Weitz &amp; Luxenberg, profited from. 

The allegation that he provided state funds in exchange for personal financial gain is important to be rooted out but the article also seemed to indict the law firms that undertook protecting those afflicted with asbestos disease and mesothelioma. 

The gist of the condemnation was that these law firms contributed money to research a cure for mesothelioma at Columbia Medical School in exchange for new clients to represent. 

The article references that because ONLY 3,000 people a year are given death sentences with a mesothelioma diagnosis, government and drug companies consider <a href="http://jcdelaw.com/mesothelioma/mesothelioma-asbestos/">mesothelioma</a> a low priority. 

What is wrong with lawyers who represent mesothelioma victims, who see the pain of families destroyed by this most deadly of cancers, contributing large sums of money for research for a cure when no one else will?

The fact that these law firms, both of whom are excellent trial counsel, may have obtained clients and if they were able to win their case, fees for their work, is only what they would do for any client. The article clearly states that Weitz &amp; Luxenberg were “not accused of wrongdoing”.

We represent the public who were poisoned by the uncaring and corrupt asbestos industry and their privately paid doctors who hid the truth about asbestos for six decades. 

The New York Times should have reminded its readers that it was the doctors on the payroll of the asbestos industry who are to be condemned and allow the public to understand that most of the victims of asbestos today would not have been exposed if industry and their doctor allies had not lied for decades.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One former Xarelto consumer is alleging negligence, fraud and other wrongdoing by the blood thinner’s manufacturers in one of the <a href="http://jcdelaw.com/xarelto-lawsuits/" title="xarelto lawsuits">first Xarelto lawsuits filed by Jacobs &amp; Crumplar, P.A.</a> and The D’Onofrio Firm.

The complaint is being brought against the manufacturers and distributors of Xarelto, which include Janssen Research &amp; Development, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Bayer Corporation, among others.

<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/xarelto-package.png" alt="xarelto-package" width="900" height="295" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1379" />

In the suit, filed in March 2015 in The Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, the Plaintiff is suing for damages in excess of $50,000 after suffering a gastrointestinal bleed as a direct result of taking a 20mg daily dose of Xarelto, which was prescribed by his physician to treat non-valvular atrial fibrillation. 

Had the Plaintiff been adequately informed of the increased health risks that come with taking the drug, he would not have used it, according to the complaint.

Xarelto (rivaroxaban) is an oral anticoagulant that first came on the market in 2011 when it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration to help reduce the risk of blood clots, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms following knee and/or hip replacement surgery, as well as to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

The developers of Xarelto have marketed the drug as a more convenient alternative to Coumadin (warfarin) since they claim that it requires “no regular blood monitoring” and has “no known dietary restrictions” like its predecessor does, according to the suit.

<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/xarelto-pill.jpg" alt="xarelto-pill" width="900" height="295" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1360" />

However, during the course of various studies that were conducted to test the effectiveness of Xarelto, it was discovered that while the blood thinner was a non-inferior treatment option, it also demonstrated an increased risk of adverse health effects such as serious bleeding, the suit states.

The complaint argues that Xarelto developers touted the positive results of the efficacy studies in their promotional and marketing materials but failed to similarly highlight the increased risk of suffering uncontrollable bleeding, therefore misleading the medical community and consumers about the potential effects of the drug.

As recent as March 2014, the Xarelto box label still does not have a “Black Box” to warn patients and prescribing doctors of the life-threatening risks that are associated with drug usage, according to the complaint. Additionally, a “Dear Doctor” letter that outlines the dangers of prescribing and administering the drug was not provided to doctors.

<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/xarelto-box.png" alt="xarelto-box" width="815" height="651" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1326" />

The suit also asserts that the drug’s manufacturers “failed to investigate, research, study and define, fully and adequately, the safety profile of Xarelto.” In the first quarter of 2012, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices “identified 356 reports of serious, disabling, or fatal injury in which rivaroxaban was the primary suspect drug.” After reviewing the same data, the manufacturers told the organization that it did not see any safety issues that needed to be addressed.

Beyond the fact that Xarelto manufacturers did not inform the Plaintiff and all others about the increased risk of uncontrollable bleeds while taking the drug, they also failed to warn or advise on how to intervene and stabilize a patient should a bleed occur, the suit alleges.

Furthermore, Xarelto advertisements did not provide an adequate disclosure to patients that “there is no drug, agent or means to reverse the anticoagulation effects of Xarelto and that such irreversibility could have life-threatening and fatal consequences.”

Heavily marketing Xarelto as a “one size fits all” drug that requires no blood monitoring or dietary restrictions caused patients and healthcare providers to be misinformed as to the necessity of routine monitoring of any person ingesting any blood thinning agent, according to the suit.

The complaint states that even if the Xarelto warnings were adequate, the drug “still lacks any benefit sufficient to tolerate the extreme risk posed by the ingestion of this drug.”

In the end, the Plaintiff is seeking compensatory damages to cover the cost of any past, present or future expenditures related to the gastrointestinal bleed that he suffered due to taking Xarelto and to pay for the lost wages, and pain and suffering as a result of his experience.

		<title>J&#038;C Wins Supreme Court Appeal of Sexual Abuse Case</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On May 21 2015 the Delaware Supreme Court decided that <a href="http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/local/2015/05/21/delaware-high-court-orders-trial-school-sex-abuse-case/27735995/">Kimberly Hecksher had a clear right of action against the Fairwinds Baptist Church School</a> for gross negligence in supervision of the school in contributing to the rape of a teenage girl student on its property. 

The case was the last of those brought under the landmark 2007 Child Victim’s Act which enabled time-barred claims based on sexual abuse of children to be brought for a period of two years in Delaware, and which eliminated the statute of limitations for civil actions based on such crimes.  

<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Fairwinds.jpg" alt="Fairwinds" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1475" />

The Supreme Court found that if a teacher or a school secretary had knowledge of inappropriate conduct of a teacher with a student, that the knowledge of the teacher or secretary was knowledge of the Church School. The teacher and/or the secretary had a duty to report the information to the school and the proper police authorities of the sexual misconduct. 

That was true even if the misconduct and harassment was not an observation of the rape itself but only of the interaction of the teacher or other school employee with students. 

Thus looking down a female students dress or making other sexual advances were all reportable and improper actions of the school employee.  Thus the School could be found negligent for its employee’s knowledge of abuse and failure to report it.  

The Supreme Court also found that the trial level judge should have allowed Ms. Hecksher’s counsel to more fully investigate the School and its employees (including its principal) to show the sexual misconduct atmosphere of the Church School.

The Supreme Court further found that if a school knowingly employs family members it cannot argue that the family member’s motivation was adverse to the school’s when one family member fails to report on the other’s sexual misconduct with a student, saying: 

<blockquote>“When an employer knowingly hires spouses, it has a reason to expect that those employees will have conflicted interests. Indeed, this conflict is a justification for anti-nepotism policies at many places of employment. If the employer chooses to hire spouses or family members despite that risk, it has a duty to take steps to ensure that the employees will not put their personal relationships above their duty to the institution and the people that it serves.”</blockquote>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Hecksher v. Fairwinds Baptist Church, Inc., 2015 Del. LEXIS 243, *35 (Del. May 21, 2015).</span>

The Court further held that Fairwinds could be liable for its personnel’s failure to respond to or report red flags which could indicate that Edward Sterling was sexually abusing Kim Hecksher.  

“Therefore, a reasonable juror could conclude that Fairwinds' failure to take any steps to inform its staff of their statutory obligation to report sexual abuse of students and train them on how to detect and prevent such abuse was an extreme departure from the required standard of care.”

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Hecksher v. Fairwinds Baptist Church, Inc., 2015 Del. LEXIS 243, *45 (Del. May 21, 2015)</span>

This reversal will allow Jacobs &amp; Crumplar to continue this case and bring justice to Ms. Hecksher.  It further signals to private schools in Delaware that they must educate and train their staff on the problem of childhood sexual abuse and the proper reactions should they observe red flags which could indicate a student is being abused. 

Raeann Warner is the lead counsel in Ms. Hecksher’s case and will now be able to move this case to conclusion.

Even though the window for filing claims under the 2007 Child Victim’s Act has passed, Jacobs &amp; Crumplar continues to file cases on behalf of sexual abuse victims. If you believe you were the <a href="http://jcdelaw.com/sexual-abuse/">victim of sexual abuse</a>, call Jacobs &amp; Crumplar today.

		<title>The Deceptive Advertising of Xarelto</title>
		<link>http://localhost/plm/blog/2015/06/24/deceptive-advertising-xarelto/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you seen the television commercials for <a href="http://jcdelaw.com/xarelto-lawsuits/">Xarelto </a>? What Arnold Palmer, Kevin Nealon, Brian Vickers and all the other promoters of Xarelto fail to tell you is that Xarelto not only is many times more expensive than generic anti-coagulant drugs such as Warfarin, but there is no known antidote in case it causes problems such as severe bleeding which is an inherent risk of such drugs.

<a href="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Xarelto-Commercial.jpg"><img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Xarelto-Commercial.jpg" alt="Xarelto Commercial" width="737" height="404" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1486" /></a>

When a patient takes Warfarin and has severe bleeding the effects can be quickly reversed with a simple and inexpensive shot of Vitamin K. For Xarelto there is presently no known antidote. If Xarelto causes severe bleeding, the patient will need to have massive blood transfusions and a prolonged stay in the hospital.

Although Johnson and Johnson and Bayer, the makers and distributors of Xarelto, are certainly well aware of this and are presumably feverishly trying to discover an antidote, you wouldn't know this from their multi-million dollar advertising campaign.

An recent article in the <a href="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Drug-May-Be-Antidote-to-Bleeding-Tied-to-Blood-Thinner-Pradaxa.pdf" />Philadelphia Inquirer</a> concerning a rival company’s anticoagulant product underscores this fact. In this article Boehringer, manufacturer of Pradaxa, proudly announces that it has found an antidote to be used if and when the use of Pradaxa causes bleeding. The real issue then is why Boehringer did not delay the release of its drug until it had completed testing for an antidote. 

And, of course, the answer is money. As the only alleged advantage that Xarelto and Pradaxa have over Warfarin is that the administration of the drug does not need the close monitoring, it is a shame that the drug makers did not wait put the drug on the market until they could market it safely, complete with a proven antidote. 

<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/xarelto-box.png" alt="xarelto-box" width="815" height="651" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1326" />

<strong>The History of Anticoagulants</strong>

Anticoagulants are a class of drugs that work to prevent the coagulation (clotting) of blood. The first known anticoagulant, Coumarin, (known now as Warfirin) was extracted from Tonka beans and sweet clover in the early 19th century by a German researcher who coined the name from the French word for Tonka beans – coumarou. 

In 1916, Jay McLean, a student at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine discovered the anticoagulant drug Heparin while researching procoagulation (the opposite of anticoagulation) in dog livers. For the last 60 years, Heparins and Coumarins have been the main durgs used for anticoagulation. 

In the last 10 years, there have been new classes of drugs that allegedly offer advantages over the traditional anticoagulant therapies. One of these drug classes, oral direct factor Xa inhibitors, of which Xarelto is a member, has been advertised as an easier alternative to the traditional methods because of its supposed ability to be administered without monitoring. 

These claims have been debunked by the medical industry itself; however, through aggressive sales and advertising the makers of these drugs have profited tremendously despite the known dangerous bleeding effects and their unnecessary high costs when compared to coumarins which are still the best and safest choices for people who need anticoagulant drugs.

		<title>Hazardous Workplaces In Delaware: Poultry Processing Plants</title>
		<link>http://localhost/plm/blog/2015/07/01/poultry-plants-hazardous-workplace/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Deboning.jpg" alt="Deboning" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1497" />A June 23, 2015 News Journal (Wilmington, DE) article about hazardous workplace conditions and injuries at a Sussex County poultry plant should not be a surprise, but should be a wake-up call to workers everywhere.

First, big agriculture is replete with safety violations. Many of our current workplace legislation originated in the early 1900’s and were the result of the public revulsion at the ghastly conditions at meat packing plants where human limbs were routinely severed. The Jungle, by Upton Sinclair, graphically described these processing facilities and sparked a national interest in making the workplace safer.  

Over a hundred years later, work conditions have sadly not improved that much. Arms are no longer routinely severed but arms and legs are often permanently damaged by working conditions that cause a variety of injuries.

What is worse is that many of these injuries, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, that are caused by repetitive work place motion, are far too often undiagnosed and even more often uncompensated for. Unlike a fall from a ladder that causes a worker to suffer a broken back, these injuries often develop gradually and sometimes the full effect is not obvious until after the worker has moved on to another job or even another state.

Because of this many workers do not take advantage of their right to file suit or make worker's compensation claims. They also wrongfully conclude that unless they have lost time from work they have no claim.

Recent studies have shown that repetitive stress injuries are one of the most common workplace injuries - common yes but not commonly compensated for.

One of the most recent studies, an April 2015 report from the <a href="http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2015/04/06/poultry-workers-cts/">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)</a> confirmed the high risk of repetitive stress injuries, like carpal tunnel syndrome, in poultry processing workers. The research for this study was performed at a poultry processing plant right here in the Delmarva region. 

NIOSH had already established the fact that a combination of repetitive tasks, forceful movements and working in cold temperatures made poultry processing workers susceptible to repetitive stress injuries but what they found in this study was truly alarming. Over 75% of the workers at the plant had abnormal results from a nerve conduction test, while 34% were diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also reviewed its records from this plant for the years 2010, 2011 and 20134 and found that sprains, strains, pain, soreness, inflammation, or repetitive motion injuries were the most common recordable injuries at the plant.  

One problem for injured workers is that many attorneys are unfamiliar with these types of injuries. It is important that any worker confirm that his or her attorney have successfully handled these types of cases in the past.

Another problem is that in the agricultural industry there is a higher percentage of immigrants, many of whom are afraid of the legal system. Some who have immigration issues are afraid if they come forward they may be deported which is almost the opposite of what actually happens; that if one has a pending legal claim the government will put a hold on any adverse immigration proceeding.

When a juicy chicken or a tender steak appears on your dinner table, you likely don’t think much about the animal’s journey from the farm to your fork. While there has been a national conversation on the humane slaughter of food animals, little attention has been given to the more than 500,000 meat and poultry processing employees in the U.S. who labor each day in an unsafe and unjust environment.

<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Hanging-drip-line.jpg" alt="Hanging-drip-line" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1498" />The meat and poultry processing workforce comprises mostly people of color living in low-income communities. At present, nearly 38 percent of the industry’s employees were born outside of this country.

An unknown portion of those workers are undocumented immigrants who heavily rely on their jobs not just as a means to support their families, but as an opportunity to continue living in the U.S. As a result, the constant fear of terminations keeps workers from reporting issues, such as injuries, and forces them to be submissive, leaving them with no power to fight back.

Even though the meat and poultry processing industry has shifted from manual labor to machinery over the years, the risk for employee injury remains high. Long hours and repetitive motions, for example, often lead to chronic pains in the workers’ hands, wrists, arms, shoulders and back. The demanding schedules also cause physical and mental exhaustion.

Stress is yet another major struggle that many workers in this industry face. Keeping up with the high speed in which many facilities operate is challenging, as companies want to maximize profits by minimizing the time it takes to complete important tasks.

One of the most disturbing aspects of this industry is the existence of a poor workplace safety culture that discourages employees from reporting injuries. Corporations seem to be more concerned with the reputation of their business on paper than with the welfare of their employees. Some companies even resort to bribery in an effort keep the number of worker comp claims low.

Dangerous, stressful and oppressive workplace conditions are taking a toll on meat and poultry processing employees across the country. With limited resources and low rank, these workers are forced to work in these environments in order to earn a living. These employees deserve to have access to a safe and fair working environment.]]></content:encoded>

Amy James wanted to get a vaccine because she had taken a job working in a day care facility.  She got the flu shot from her family doctor during a routine visit. Within hours her legs were starting to get weak. As the day progressed she started falling down and eventually the weakness progressed to her entire body to the point where she could not perform simple functions such as feeding herself or going to the bathroom. By the end of the day she couldn’t walk. 

By the time Amy came to our office, after a lengthy hospital stay, many of her symptoms had improved but she was still in a wheel chair and unable to take care of her young child.  Most people who get vaccines have no serious problems. In rare cases the recipient suffers from severe allergic reactions which often times can be debilitating or result in death.

The <a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/index.html">National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program</a> (“VICP”) was created by Congress in 1986 to compensate those injured by vaccines without litigation.  This attempt at tort reform was the first acknowledgment by this organization that vaccine injuries and death are not a myth, but are real with catastrophic consequences for the lives of the vaccine injured and their families who care for them. 

The United States Court of Federal Claims decides who will be paid. The VICP is located in the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The United States Department of Justice represents the agency before the VICP.  You may file a claim if you have received a vaccine in the United States which is covered by the VICP and believe that you have been injured by this vaccine with symptoms of which have lasted more than six months after the vaccine was given; or 2) resulted in a hospital stay and surgery; or 3) resulted in death.

The Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund provides funding for the VICP to compensate vaccine related injuries or death claims for covered vaccines administered after 1986. The trust fund is funded by an excise tax on vaccines recommended by the CDC for routine administration such as the flu vaccine or the measles.

The VICP is an alternative to the tort system for resolving vaccine injury claims. The petitioner must first exhaust the remedies under the VICP before they can pursue a legal action against a vaccine administrator outside of the VICP. The petitioner must either withdraw their petition or reject the judgment under the VICP before pursuing a claim in state court.

<strong>Vaccine Safety FAQ - From Immunization.org</strong>

<em>Does the thimerosal in some vaccines pose a risk? </em>

Thimerosal, a very effective preservative, has been used to prevent bacterial contamination in vaccine vials for more than 50 years. It contains a type of mercury known as ethylmercury, which is different from the type of mercury found in fish and seafood (methylmercury). At very high levels, methylmercury can be toxic to people, especially to the neurological development of infants. 

In recent years, several large scientific studies have determined that thimerosal in vaccines does not lead to neurologic problems, such as autism. Nonetheless, because we generally try to reduce people's exposure to mercury if at all possible, vaccine manufacturers have voluntarily changed their production methods to produce vaccines that are now free of thimerosal or have only trace amounts. They have done this because it is possible to do, not because there was any evidence that the thimerosal was harmful.

Some parents are requesting that we space out their infant's vaccinations because they are concerned that receiving multiple vaccinations at a single office visit might overwhelm the infant's immune system. 

<em>What do you think about using alternative schedules?</em>

Vaccine recommendations are determined after extensive studies in large clinical trials. They include studies on how vaccine recipients respond to multiple vaccines given simultaneously. The overall aim is to provide early protection for infants and children against vaccine-preventable diseases that could endanger their health and life. No scientific evidence exists to support that delaying vaccinations or separating them into individual antigens is beneficial for children. 

Rather, this practice prolongs susceptibility to disease, which could result in a greater likelihood of the child becoming sick with a serious or life-threatening disease. There could also be added expense (e.g., multiple office visits), additional time off from work for parents, and increased likelihood that the child will fail to get all necessary vaccinations.

<em>Where can I find more information to help address my patients' concerns about vaccine safety?</em>

There are many excellent websites that have information about vaccine safety, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the CDC, Every Child by Two, the Immunization Action Coalition, the National Network for Immunization Information, the Institute of Medicine, and the Vaccine Education Center, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

		<title>Matt Denn Knows the Value of Police Foot Patrols in Wilmington but the Delaware Assembly Only Knows $$$</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We, as residents of Wilmington, DE have been <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2014/12/19/wilmington-delaware-murder-crime-290232.html">embarrassed and saddened by headlines</a> such as "Murder Town, USA." Attorney General Matt Denn who was sworn in to office on January 6, 2015 has made it his mission to reduce crime, especially violent crime, in the City of Wilmington.  He has often discussed how other cities with high crime incidents were able to reduce crime by having a visible presence of law enforcement officers in known high-crime areas.  

<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Matt-Denn.jpg" alt="Matt Denn" width="972" height="472" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1531" />

He didn’t just talk; he took action and made it happen by applying for a grant from the state’s Neighborhood Building Blocks Fund. Since March of this year seven officers have staffed the overtime patrols nightly in high-crime areas. 

According to reports in the News Journal, residents generally welcomed this police presence. Denn had reportedly reviewed statistics that showed a 2/3 drop off in the rate of homicides since the patrols began in March as compared with the first two months of this year, according to Shana O’Malley’s story in WDEL on June 30, 2015. 

As was reported in the News Journal on July 1, 2015, Mr. Denn was disappointed with the decision of the Delaware General Assembly to use "one-time financial settlement funds [from bank settlements related to the 2008 financial crisis] to balance the budget, and not to fund foot police patrols in Wilmington."  

He had advocated for using some of the money to pay for the continuation of police overtime patrols in crime-ridden areas. Mr. Denn has said foot patrols in Wilmington will end soon without an appropriation from the General Assembly's budget committee. This is a shame to see a promising initiative that appeared to be working abruptly end in its infancy.  

<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Wilmington.jpg" alt="Wilmington" width="945" height="552" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1532" />

Knowing Mr. Denn, he is likely looking for solutions and will find them. However he needs us to voice our support and encourage our representatives to do the same. I hope that we as voters will encourage our legislature to support the foot patrols and other initiatives to try to combat crime in this city to make it a safe place for families to live and for businesses to thrive.  

Market Street is seeing a bit of a resurgence through private investments, including new restaurants and several new apartment units, but at the same time Wilmington has this serious crime problem. In such a small state, what happens in Wilmington whether for good or bad invariably effects suburban and rural parts of the state.  

The new policies have been working – Wilmington is already a safer place - yet unbelievably the General Assembly has cut off important funding for foot patrols for the City and instead is using funds to balance the budget.  While balanced budgets are laudable and important for the state financial security,  using this money to fight crime in Wilmington would in the long run pay off greater financially for the State than the temporarily balancing of the budget.

		<title>Protecting Our Children: Delaware And Other States Take Action On Behalf of Human Trafficking Victims</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In 2014, the Delaware legislature signed into law S. B 197, a bill to fight human trafficking. 

Human trafficking is the trade of humans, most commonly for the purpose of sexual slavery, forced labor or commercial sexual exploitation for the trafficker or others. Forced labor and human trafficking is a billion dollar industry. 

<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/delaware-dover-legislative-building-1024x532.jpg" alt="delaware-dover-legislative-building" width="1024" height="532" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1554" />

The International Labor Organization estimates 20.9 million victims of human trafficking globally. 

Human trafficking includes bonded labor, forced labor and includes the trafficking of children. S.B. 197 uses provisions of the Uniform Law Commission's Uniform Act on Prevention of and Remedies for Human Trafficking Act. 

Other states have also stepped up their efforts to address issues related to human trafficking:

In March 2014, the State of Maryland established a Maryland Human Trafficking Policy Advisor position to develop and implement policies, training, and data collection procedures that build Maryland’s capacity to combat trafficking and serve survivors. 

<a href="http://cnsmaryland.org/human-trafficking/story/maryland-legislature-enacted-three-new-laws-aid-human-trafficking.html">The Maryland legislature also passed three bills</a> on behalf of victims of human trafficking including protections from prosecution for youths forced into prostitution and free community college for victims of trafficking. 

Pennsylvania’s Act 105, <a href="http://www.novabucks.org/otherinformation/humantraffickinglegislation/">which became law in September 2014</a>, added new definitions of sex trafficking to the Criminal Code and established expanded legal protections for victims of trafficking. 

Act 105 also establishes a civil cause of action so that victims may seek compensatory and punitive damages along with other appropriate relief against their traffickers.

<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/sextrafficking.jpg" alt="sextrafficking" width="534" height="401" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1553" />

The Human Trafficking Prevention, Protection and Treatment Act in New Jersey makes it possible for victims to have unjust convictions removed from their records. The Act also provides witness protection for victims and makes it easier for law enforcement to prosecute the traffickers.

These protections, on behalf of our most vulnerable children, as well as others passed at the state and federal level, are helping to restore the rights and freedoms that have been stolen from them. ]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Cancer in Delaware: The Industrial Impact</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, the News Journal published an article about Delaware’s high lung cancer rate: the state ranks 17th in the nation for the number of men suffering from the disease and 3rd for women.  

The article does point out that Delaware’s cancer rates have improved: in the 1990s Delaware’s cancer death rate was second in the country, but it is now 14th.

<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/industrial-pollution-1024x682.jpg" alt="industrial-pollution" width="1024" height="682" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1568" />

<strong>What is to blame for the Delaware’s high cancer rate?</strong>  

According to the article smoking is the reason – about 20 percent of Delawareans still smoke.  What the article fails to address is that many other factors can contribute to a state cancer’s rate. 

Other factors include the presence of heavy industry in the state.  For years, deadly products such as asbestos and benzene were used throughout Delaware, often at companies that were among the largest employers in the state.  Even for those who did not work directly with these products, they often had secondhand exposure from contact with friends and family and also through environmental exposure (in the air and water).

Delaware was host to two companies who used massive amounts of asbestos in the manufacture of various products: Haveg in Marshallton and Amoco in New Castle. From the 1930’s to 1980, these plants used tons of raw asbestos that circulated freely around the working areas and blew out of windows into the community. 

Several years ago the News Journal published a feature on several generations of one family that was devastated by cancer caused by asbestos at the Haveg plant. Many Delawareans have filed cases against asbestos manufacturers or have filed workers compensation actions after being diagnosed with cancer from asbestos. Many of these individuals never smoked in their lives.

<strong>Utah is another case in point that smoking is not necessarily the only factor that contributes to a state’s cancer rate.  </strong>

Utah has the highest percentage of Latter Day Saints (Mormons) of any state in the country.  Mormon theology forbids the use of tobacco, hence Utah has the lowest percentage of tobacco users of any state.  

<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/DelawareCityRefinery.jpg" alt="DelawareCityRefinery" width="400" height="268" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1566" />

Despite this, Utah has an incredibly high cancer, due in part to the number of individuals who work in heavy industry, particularly uranium mines.   

Not only have former miners gotten sick and died, but those lived near the mines, including many children have developed diseases like leukemia and lung cancer and ultimately died. Thousands of abandoned uranium mines still remain throughout the state.  

<strong>So, while smoking certainly contributes to a state’s cancer rate, it is by far not the only factor. </strong>

It is too convenient for industry to blame the victim, the dying cancer patient, and ignore their contribution.  Improvements in public health require more than simply changing personal lifestyles - corporate lifestyles also need to change, placing human health needs before profits. ]]></content:encoded>

		<title>National Media Quote Raeann Warner as Sex Abuse Specialist in Molly Shattuck Case</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Raeann Warner of Jacobs &amp; Crumplar was recently quoted by the Washington Post and the Baltimore Sun on the sentencing of Molly Shattuck. 

In June 2015, Shattuck pled guilty to fourth degree rape in the sexual assault of a 15 year old boy. She was sentenced on August 21, 2015 to 48 weekends in a community corrections center. Raeann commented on the light sentence given to Shattuck.  

<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Molly-Shattuck.jpg" alt="Molly Shattuck" width="750" height="422" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1576" />
 
<strong><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/former-nfl-cheerleader-to-be-sentenced-for-raping-teen-boy/2015/08/21/d56dc8b6-47d2-11e5-9f53-d1e3ddfd0cda_story.html">In the Washington Post:</a></strong>
 
Raeann Warner, a Delaware attorney who specializes in sexual abuse cases, said she was surprised that Shattuck was not given any prison time.
“It just seems light ... and not in accord with sentences in cases involving less heinous sexual acts that were committed by males,” Warner said. “I hope it’s not because she’s a woman.”
 
<strong><a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-shattuck-sentencing-20150820-story.html">In the Baltimore Sun:</a></strong>
 
Raeann Warner, a civil attorney in Delaware who represents sexual abuse victims, said she was surprised by the sentence. She said many people tend to think that abuse by female perpetrators against male victims is less serious than it is. "That's not fair or right, because boys are just as scarred by this," she said.
 
Tom Crumplar has <a href="http://jcdelaw.com/molly-shattuck-double-standard-of-rape/">previously blogged about this case</a> and the double standards he pointed out when women rape young boys appear to have been borne out in the sentencing of Molly Shattuck.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Farm Workers Sue Monsanto For Roundup Exposure</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As reported on <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/15/reuters-america-us-lawsuits-build-against-monsanto-over-alleged-roundup-cancer-link.html">CNBC's website</a> on October 15, 2015, Jacobs &amp; Crumplar along with the firms of LUNDY, LUNDY, SOILEAU &amp; SOUTH, LLP and WEITZ &amp; LUXENBERG, P.C. filed a lawsuit on October 14, 2015 on behalf of three plaintiffs who as farm workers were exposed to Roundup, a pesticide sold by Monsanto.  

<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Roundup.jpg" alt="Roundup" width="719" height="395" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1593" />

The lawsuit alleges that these plaintiffs are suffering from serious diseases such as and chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  

The lawsuit claims that Defendant Monsanto Company, Inc. <a href="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Barrera-Original-stamped-complaint.pdf">began marketing glyphosate in products in 1974</a> under the brand name Roundup®. Roundup® is a non-selective herbicide used to kill weeds that commonly compete with the growing of crops.  

On March 20, 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (“IARC”), an agency of the World Health Organization (“WHO”), issued an evaluation of several herbicides, including glyphosate. 

That evaluation was based, in part, on studies of exposures to glyphosate in several countries around the world, and it traces the health implications from exposure to glyphosate since 2001.On July 29, 2015, IARC issued the formal monograph relating to glyphosate.  

<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/monsanto.jpg" alt="monsanto" width="700" height="249" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1592" />

In that monograph, the IARC Working Group provides a thorough review of the numerous studies and data relating to glyphosate exposure in humans.   The IARC Working Group classified glyphosate as a Group 2A herbicide, which means that it is probably carcinogenic to humans. 

The IARC Working Group concluded that the cancers most associated with glyphosate exposure are non-Hodgkin lymphoma and other haematopoietic cancers, including lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, and multiple myeloma.  

The lawsuit alleges that  Monsanto knew or should have known of the hazards and dangers of Roundup® and specifically, the carcinogenic properties of the chemical glyphosate prior to the times that plaintiffs were exposed to its product and that it failed to warn them and other consumers of the dangers of  exposure to its product. 

The plaintiffs were exposed to Roundup at various times between the 1980s and the 2000s.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Civil Suit Only Remedy for Inmate Killed By Corrections Officers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As reported in The News Journal on December 15, 2015, even though an autopsy and death certificate ruled inmate Ronald Shoup's death a homicide, the Delaware Attorney General's Office will not pursue criminal charges against the correctional officers who caused his death.

<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/AG-Shield.png" alt="AG Shield" width="972" height="100" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1611" />  

Mr. Shoup, incarcerated for drunk driving, tragically died when five officers crushed him under their weight while restraining him hours before his death, as a forensic pathologist found. His death was labeled a homicide due to blunt force trauma.  

The decision specifically stated that it did not rule out the possibility that the policy, training, and procedures at DOC were inadequate or that correctional officers could not be held liable in a civil suit. Mr. Shoup’s attorney confirmed that a civil suit would be forthcoming.  

This highlights the importance of civil suits in achieving justice for victims when the State cannot or will not do so.  It is important to remember that lawyers for the State work on behalf of the State and are not lawyers for victims of negligence by the State or other people or entities. This case highlights the importance of civil lawsuits in obtaining justice for people who are the victims of wrongdoing.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Jacobs &#038; Crumplar File Civil Rights Action On Behalf Of McDole Family</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today the grandmother and mother of Jeremy McDole filed a state court civil rights action for the tragic and unnecessary death of Jeremy, a 28 year old young black man, who was not suffering from mental health issues, but who was shot 16 times by allegedly poorly trained and unqualified police officers and killed, while paralyzed from the waist down sitting in a wheelchair.  

As shown by a contemporaneous video that went viral, he was unarmed, his hands were on his lap, sitting in broad daylight out in the open with plenty of nearby cover for the police.  Jeremy was not combative or physically aggressive, nor did he say anything threatening or verbally taunt the police.  Nor was he fleeing from the scene of a felonious crime which involved serious physical injury, or a threat of imminent harm to anyone.  Jeremy's assailants never identified themselves to him verbally as "Police" when they issued him commands before recklessly shooting him excessively.  And they also never warned Jeremy that deadly force would be used against him to take his life if their commands were not followed. 

 <img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Wilmington-Seal.jpg" alt="Wilmington Seal" width="336" height="336" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1625" /> 

The officers involved allegedly violated the Wilmington Police Department “Use of Force” Directive, due either to their poor training or lack of qualifications to be police officers licensed to use deadly force.  The general state of such institutional failures within their police department has been highlighted recently in a Delaware judicial dissent.  Before using deadly force, Jeremy could have been talked down by a properly trained professional using historic police methods before a cowboy mentality seeped into current day police training and police work.  Also, lesser forms of force could have been utilized, such as, for example, a stun gun, a taser, pepper spray, tear gas or other chemical weapon, rubber buckshot or a bean bag shotgun.

Jacobs and Crumplar have filed this lawsuit in order to get answers for a grieving family who have nothing but questions as to how and why their beloved son, grandson, and brother could have been killed by the police when there is a video which shows that this killing was not justified .

Since its founding over 35 years ago, Jacobs and Crumplar has occupied only two places:  one at 800 Delaware Avenue in Wilmington and for most of the firm's existence at 2 East 7th Street also in Wilmington.  After almost 30 years at 2 East 7th Street, the firm is moving this time to the Wilmington Riverfront and specifically 750 Riverfront Drive, right near the Wilmington Blue Rocks stadium.  The new home for the firm is a modern yet classic looking office building that is the home of other businesses.  Jacobs &amp; Crumplar will occupy the second floor of the building.  The firm's old location will be renovated into apartments with a restaurant occupying the first floor.

Any move is a process, and moving an entire law firm that has been in the same building for almost 30 years is no exception.  The entire staff has been spending extra time going through old documents, scanning files, and figuring out what needs to keep and what can be thrown away.  

The new office is conveniently located off of I95, which will allow clients coming from all over northern Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey to get to the office, with plenty of parking as well.  The new office is only a short drive to the New Castle County Courthouse. Jacobs &amp; Crumplar still has a satellite office in Georgetown, DE to serve its clients in southern Delaware.

The area around the new office has blossomed in the last couple years with many new apartments, stores, and restaurants opening up.  The entire firm is excited about this new chapter in the history of Jacobs &amp; Crumplar.]]></content:encoded>

In American unlike many countries the Police have a proud a tradition they are here “To Serve and  To Protect “ whereas in many countries there function is to suppress dissent. Sadly in many inner city communities the police are viewed more as more of an occupying force.  There is too much distrust between the police and the inner community which more than any other place in America needs a police which will “Serve and Protect” 
 
There are bad actors in every field and we make a  mistake because we want to support the police for risking their lives to protect us to give special protection for police misconduct. No group whether they are doctors lawyers or police officers are above the law.  This is especially true because when there is police misconduct the consequences are widespread- people die and communities are shattered.

<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Voting.jpg" alt="voting" width="750" height="452" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1670" />
 
The question then becomes what are the best checks on police misconduct. Criminal prosecution have been tried but almost without exception they have failed . Civil lawsuit in contrast have been relatively successful. Money talks and the threat of large judgments more often than not will force police forces to institute long overdue policy changes in the use of force and improved training.
 
These lawsuits also bring pubic attention to various shortcomings and may engender more political involvement . Sadly voter participation in inner cities is far below what it is in the suburbs. The police report to elected officials and the elected officials report to the voters. The best way to insure that the victims of police misconduct did not die in vain is to vote.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>When the Police Are Trigger Happy, No One is Safe</title>

The police who risk their lives everyday are understandably concerned when they get a report about an attempted suicide. People with a gun, especially emotionally distraught ones, can pose a risk to others.

The police need special training to prevent a bad situation from getting worse. Yesterday, again, it appears that rather than "talking down" and stopping a potential suicide, the Wilmington police shot first and ended up killing a man on his front porch.

This recent killing hit home to me. First it reminded me of the September 2015 killing of a young paralyzed wheelchair bound African-American man, Jeremy McDole. My law firm, Jacobs &amp; Crumplar, represented his family in a law suit which recently resulted in the City of Wilmington paying his family 1.5 million dollars to settle their wrongful death suit.

<img src="http://jcdelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Wilmington-Seal-300x300.jpg" alt="Wilmington Seal" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1625" />Yesterday’s killing was literally closer to my home. It occurred in the neighborhood where If have lived for over 30 and was inches away from where my son presently lives. My son and I live in a racially diverse neighborhood full of young families and young professionals. 

On the very porch where my neighbor was shot, I often chatted with the family that used to live there. Just a year ago they moved out and the new resident, a middle-aged DuPont engineer, was the individual shot and killed. 

When the McDole settlement was announced, it was noted that the City of Wilmington was in the process of adopting a new use of force policy. This recent shooting may indicate that it can't come soon enough.

After an exhaustive investigation, the Complaint charges that for 16 years it was the policy of these two Governors not to employ enough officers to safely run Delaware prisons. Instead, they spent up to $23 million a year forcing understaffed officers to work 16 hour overtime shifts, to save money at the expense of risking human lives at the hands of violent criminals, as reported by The News Journal at the attached link.
